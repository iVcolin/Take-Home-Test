# Positive aspects 

Hi Student, thanks for the submission!

This was a really good effort! Your writing is excellent. Your code is now easier to read because you used comments well.
Your variables are generally well named. They provide a thorough explanation of what they are doing and why you need them there.
Only a few corrections need to be done in order to mark this assignment as finished.

# Aspects that could be improved 

Instead of writing a method, you printed out the Fibonacci series of ten digits on line 11 of your code.
You called a method named "reverseString" that you did not create on line 26 of your code. Please make sure you use the right method name when calling the method you generated.
Your code's line 30 displays the following error notice. Please be sure to check at that section of your code if you receive the message "Variable'maxNumber' is already declared in the scope."

General

Eliminate any unnecessary whitespace from your code.
According to Java naming conventions. Please keep in mind that the camelCase convention.
The method name is'reverse string' rather than'reverseString' on line 18 of your code.
